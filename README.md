Capstone project for the Master in Big Data and Business Analytics: "Diabetes/Pre-diabetes risk assessment using a machine learning model"
The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset was used for this work. This dataset is based on the 2015 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and contains information on risk factors associated with diabetes.
The dataset consists of 70,692 observations and 22 variables, where "diabetes_binary" is the binary target variable.
The main objective of this work is to construct a machine learning model that can predict the probability of a person developing prediabetes or diabetes. In addition, the model will be productized by creating a web application.
